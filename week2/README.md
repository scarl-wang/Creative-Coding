# Week 2
I've created a yellow smiley face in the middle of the screen with red concentric circles radiating from the emoji. The smiley face is made up of a circle, 2 elipses, and an arc. To create the repeating circles, I referenced the *Color and Form* tutorial and created two variables, 'myDiameter' and 'gap', which allows me to adjust the size and spacing of the circles easily without having to change the parameters in each line.

> "For instance, the unease pondering what it might mean to have some of our thinking done out of body by an external device is arguably just a computer-era version of the challenges to self-image o “proprioception” posed by industrial machinery. The industrial age challenged us to rethink the limits of the human body: Where does my body end and the tool begin? The digital age challenges us to rethink the limits of the human mind: What are the boundaries of my cognition?" - *Douglas Rushkoff, p16*.

Technology can be seen as a tool and extension of human abilities. The ability to program and understanding how it works is the ability to harness this tool, just like when humans gained proficiency in machinery in the industrial ages. I agree with this view and think it's productive to see programming as a tool that furthers our abilities to create and produce. It is also true that technology has a greater danger to overtake human thought compared to machinery to physical labor - even though a lot of craftsmanship was lost to the development of manufacturing - as it is tempting to utilize these technologies mindlessly rather than understanding its underlying logic and systems.

> "Most of the smart folks who could help us are too busy consulting to corporations - teaching them how to maintain their faltering monopolies in the face of the digital tsunami. Who has time to consider much else, and who is going to pay for it?"  - *Douglas Rushkoff, p19*.

This stuck out to me because it frames learning how to code for oneself as a form of resistance to capitalist systems, which is a perspective I haven't thought about. I agree that learning programming skills can be empowering to individuals, as it allows one to develop their understanding of technologies and systems that are often monopolized and controlled by corporations and those in positions of power. 

> "As this writer puts it, “AI writing, meanwhile, is a cognitive pyramid scam. It’s a fraud on the reader. The writer who uses AI is trying to get the reader to invest their time and attention without investing any of their own.” -Patrick Lin

This echoes with Douglas Rushkoff's point that technology poses the danger of replacing human thinking. The analogy of a "cognitive pyramid scam" is so interesting and accurate to me as the undisclosed use of AI in any sort of interactions can lead to an imbalance in the amount of effort invested by each party. It can be deceiving, disrespectful, and exploitative, just like a pyramid scheme. The use of AI replaces any need to invest time, energy, or thinking into learning programming, which can in turn hinder our development in logical and systemic thinking as well as problem solving skills.

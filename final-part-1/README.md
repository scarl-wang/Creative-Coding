# Final Project - Part 1

interactive story & selections

- added the selection screens with flickering text and flickering stars in the background
- added interactivity (currently only with mouse) and allows for user selection
- saved user selection in an array of objects

I feel really inspired by this tutorial and want to make the final screen to project different variations of supertoroids as the head of the user based on their selections.

Parameters that can be made responsive:

- Rotation speed
- Direcion of rotation
- R1 (radius of donut shape)
- R2 (radius of the small circles)
- Repetition frequency

Next steps:

- create outline of body using webcam + faceMesh
- create an animated supertoroids with adjustable parameters to be projected onto the head
